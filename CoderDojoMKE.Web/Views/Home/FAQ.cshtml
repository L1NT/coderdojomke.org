        <h3>Does my child need to already know code?</h3>
        <p>
            There are no requirements for attending a CoderDojo class other than bringing yourself
            and a desire to learn. Every Dojo teaches a basic introduction to making a webpage as a
            starting point to learning how to code. From there, children begin to learn how to code
            in more advanced languages by learning from each other and from the mentors.

        <h3>What level IT skills do students need at the start?</h3>
        <p>
            It's recommended that they have used a computer and browsed the internet before 
            but no real computer skills are needed. The point is to introduce kids to programming 
            and inspire them to explore technology on their own.

        <h3>Can/Should I stay with my child during the class?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! We highly encourage parents to stay with their children throughout the process. 
            This allows everyone to learn something new and amazing! In addition, students age 12
            and under are required to have a parent present.

    <div class="faq-question-wrapper">
        <h3>Do we need to provide a laptop?</h3>
        <p>
            That depends on the ticket type you signed up for in the EventBrite registration.  Please take note
            of the kind of ticket you are requesting (Bring PC vs. PC Provided) in order to determine whether or 
            not you should bring a laptop.  In general, we recommend if you can bring a laptop, that you do so as 
            that will leave tickets available for those who may not be able to provide their own laptop.
