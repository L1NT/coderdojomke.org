        CoderDojo MKE is a free and open organization where youths age 7-17 can come to learn to code by doing.
        Started in August 2014 by <a href="http://www.nathangrier.com">Nathan Grier</a>, the chapter celebrated
        its launch on September 6<sup>th</sup> with many more sessions planned for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        At a Dojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and much more. 
        In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. 
        CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable and awesome experience. CoderDojo also puts a 
        strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. 
        CoderDojo has just one rule: &quot;Above All: Be Cool&quot;, bullying, lying, wasting people’s time and so on is uncool.
